Multithreading:
---Great for I/O-bound tasks, but not effective for CPU-bound tasks because of the GIL.
---In CPU-bound operations, threading won't provide parallelism on multiple CPU cores.

Multiprocessing:
---Ideal for CPU-bound tasks like factorial computation, matrix operations, image processing, etc.
---Bypasses the GIL and runs each task in a separate process, taking advantage of multi-core CPUs.

The Global Interpreter Lock (GIL):
In Python (especially with CPython, which is the most commonly used implementation of Python),
there’s a mechanism called the Global Interpreter Lock (GIL).
The GIL essentially allows only one thread to execute Python bytecode at a time, even on multi-core machines.
This means that even if you're using multiple threads, only one thread can be executing Python code at any given moment.
The GIL is designed for thread safety, but it also limits concurrency, especially in CPU-bound tasks.
